                    What is a heap ? 
                </summary>
            <p>
            Heaps are used in many famous algorithms such as Dijkstra's 
            algorithm for finding the shortest path, the heap sort sorting 
            algorithm, implementing priority queues, and more. Essentially, 
            heaps are the data structure you want to use when you want to be 
            able to access the maximum or minimum element very quickly.There 
            are many variations of heaps, each offering advantages and 
            tradeoffs.<br>

            <b>Definition</b><br>
            The (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can
            view as a nearly complete binary tree as shown in the figure
            below.Each node of the tree corresponds to an element of the 
            array. The tree is completely filled on all levels except 
            possibly the lowest, which is filled from the left up to a point.

            Three are two types of heaps: <br>
            1) Max Heap <br>
            2) Min Heap <br>

            In the max heap the parent nodes are always greater than or 
            equal to those of the children and the root node is the one with
            the highest key value.

            In the case of min heap the keys of the parent nodes are always
            less than or equal to those of the children and the lowest key is 
            in the root node.

                    Maintaining the heap property
                </summary>
            <p>
            Heapify is a procedure for manipulating heap data structures. 
            It is given an array A and index i into the array.
            The subtree rooted at the children of A[i] are heap but node A[i]
            itself may possibly violate the heap property i.e., A[i] < A[2i]
            or A[i] < A[2i +1]. The procedure 'Heapify' manipulates the tree 
            rooted at A[i] so it becomes a heap. In other words, 'Heapify' 
            is let the value at A[i] "float down" in a heap so that subtree 
            rooted at index i becomes a heap.<br><br>
            There are two general versions of the heap property: a min-heap 
            property and a max-heap property.

                If A is an array representation of a heap, then in Max-heap: <br>
                A[parent[i]] > A[i] <br>
                which means that a node can't have a greater value than its 
                parent. In a max-heap, the largest element
                is stored at the root, and the minimum elements are in the
                leaves.

            <p>
            Heapify picks the largest child key and compare it to the parent
            key.
            If parent key is larger than heapify quits, otherwise it swaps the
            parent key with the largest child key. So that the parent is now
            becomes larger than its children.It is important to note that swap
            may 
            destroy the heap property of the subtree rooted at the largest
            child node.
            If this is the case, Heapify calls itself again using largest
            child node as the new root. <br><br>
            <code>
            Heapify (A, i) <br>
            &nbsp l = left [i]  <br>
            &nbsp r = right [i]  <br>

            Heapsort is a comparison based sorting algorithm that uses a 
            binary heap data structure. Like mergesort, heapsort has a running
            time of O(nlogn) and like insertion sort, heapsort sorts in-place
            so no extra space is needed during the sort. The binary heap data 
            structure allows the heapsort algorithm to take advantage of the 
            heap's heap properties and the heapsort algorithm makes use of the
            efficient running time for inserting to and deleting from the heap
            .<br>

            <p>
            The heap sort algorithm starts by using procedure BUILD-HEAP to 
            build a heap on the input array A[1 . . n]. Since the maximum 
            element of the array stored at the root A[1], it can be put into 
            its correct final position by exchanging it with A[n] (the last
            element in A). If we now discard node n from the heap than the
            remaining elements can be made into heap. Note that the new 
            element at the root may violate the heap property. All that is 
            needed to restore the heap property. <br><br>
            <code>
            HEAPSORT(A) <br>
            &nbsp BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A) <br>
            &nbsp for i = A.length downto 2 <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      exchange A[1] with A[i] <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      A.heap-size = A.head-size - 1 <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      MAX-HEAPIFY(A, 1) <br><br><br>
            </code>
            The HEAPSORT procedure takes time O(n lg n), since the call to 
            BUILD_HEAP takes time O(n) and each of the n -1 calls to Heapify 
            takes time O(lg n).

            Although heapsort is an excellent algorithm, a good implementation
            of quick sort which you are gonna learn later is gonna beat 
            heapsort in practice. The heap data structure has a lot of varied 
            use but it is most popularly used to implement priority queues.
            <br><br>

            Heap is generally preferred for priority queue implementation 
            because heaps provide better performance when compared to priority
            queues implemented using arrays or linked list. In a Binary Heap, 
            <code>getHighestPriority()</code> can be implemented in <code> 
            O(1) time </code>, <code> insert() </code> can be implemented in 
            <code> O(Logn) </code> time and <code> deleteHighestPriority()
            </code> can also be implemented in <code> O(Logn) </code> time 
            as compared to <code> O(n) </code> in case of linked list etc.

            Some of the applications of the priority queues are as follows<br>
            <br>
            1) <strong> Schedule jobs on a shared computer</strong> 
            : We can use max-priority queues to schedule jobs on a 
            shared computer. The max-priority queue keeps track of the jobs 
            to be performed and their relative priorities. When a job is 
            finished or interrupted, the scheduler selects the 
            highest-priority job from among those pending by calling
            <code>EXTRACT-MAX</code>. The scheduler can add a new job to 
            the queue at any time by calling <code>INSERT</code>. <br>

            2) <strong>Event driven simulator</strong>: A min-priority queue
            can be used in an event driven simulator.The items in the queue 
            are events to be simulated, each with an associated time of 
            occurrence that serves as its key. The events must be simulated 
            in order of their time of occurrence, because the simulation 
            of an event can cause other events to be simulated in the future
            <br>

            3) <strong>Graph Search Algorithms</strong>: Many efficient graph
            search algorithms such as <code>A* search</code> and 
            <code>Dijkstra's algorithm </code> use priority queues to know 
            which nodes to explore next.<br>

            4) <strong>Bandwidth Management</strong>: Priority queues are used
            to handle data flows on the network. As not all data are of same 
            importance by prioritizing the important data packets the router 
            can make sure that the network performs optimally and all the 
            prioritized traffic is forwarded with the least delay and the 
            least likelihood of being rejected in case of the router reaching 
            its max traffic capacity.

                    Run the Python code
                </summary>

                <p>
                    In the console below, type or paste:
                    <br/>
                    <code>
                        !git clone https://gist.github.com/17b7d4beac379c4e11448a62a9a94a1b.git
                        <br/>
                        cd 17b7d4beac379c4e11448a62a9a94a1b
                        <br/>
                        from heapsort import *
                        <br/>
                        A = [4, 1, 3, 2, 16, 9, 10, 14, 8, 7]
                        <br/>
                    </code>
                </p>

                <!--include python_anywhere.txt -->

                <p>
                    To run the example from the textbook, type:
                    <br/>
                    <code>
                        A
                        <br/>
                        # MAX or MIN
                        <br/>
                        build_heap(A, MAX)
                        <br/>
                        heapsort(A, MAX)
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you can experiment with the algorithm by typing
                    in your own array (my_array = [x, y, z])
                    and running build_heap(my_array) or
                    heapsort(a_array, b_array).
                </p>
