                13.1 What is a red-black tree?
            </summary>

                <p>
                    The colors (indeed, using any color at all -- we could call
                    them 0 and 1 trees!) are arbitrary. One story from one of
                    the creators is that they had red and black pens handy!

                </summary>
    
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Every node is red or black.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The root is black.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every leaf (<i>T.nil</i>) is black.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a node is red, then both of its children are
                        black. (Never two reds in a row while descending!)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For each node, all paths from the node to its
                        descendant leaves contain the same number of black
                        nodes.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    <b>T.nil</b>: This is simply a space saving device: every
                    "leaf" node of an ordinary BST gets left and right child
                    pointers to a special node, <i>T.nil</i>, and the root node
                    of the tree has its parent point to this as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And so, a simple way to get an intuition as
                    to why no leaf is further than
                    twice as far from the root as the nearest leaf: The
                    nearest leaf at the least <i>bh</i> levels from the root.
                    (The black-height of every node is the same.)
                    Since there is never more than one R-node
                    between any two B-nodes, at
                    most, the furthest node can be 2B levels away from
                    the root.
                    <br />
                    So we get:
                    <br />
                    A red-black tree with <i>n</i> internal nodes has height at
                    most 2 lg(<i>n</i> + 1).

                    Operations on red-black trees
                </summary>
    
                <p>
                    <b>Remember:</b> This <i>is</i> a binary search tree.
                    <br>
                    So, non-modifying operations such as minimum(),
                    maximum(), successor(), predecessor(), and search() run
                    in O(height) time, and so for red-black trees, in O(lg
                    n) time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But what about insert and delete? They are obviously
                    trickier. In fact, they are the whole trick: the
                    red-black properties are just a way of keeping the tree
                    roughly balanced.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    But to get to insert and delete, we need to pass
                    through rotations on the way.
