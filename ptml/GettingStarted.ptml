                  <p>
                      We surely do not want to talk about actual time
                      in nanoseconds, as that depends on too
                      many external things: what other
                      processes are running, details of the
                      hardware, compiler switches, etc, etc. 
                      So instead we come up with a very
                      primitive <em>abstract machine</em> (RAM=the
                      Random Access Machine: CPU + directly
                      addressable memory) which we analyze instead
                      of a real computer.  Then primitive
                      operations are memory reads/writes and operations
                      in the CPU, such as address arithmetic,
                      additions, multiplications, divisions,
                      etc. Our idea of "running time" is then
                      simply the number of operations
                      performed when the program runs.

                  <p>
                  Even for inputs of a fixed size (saying, your favorite program
                    sorting 10 numbers), different specific
                    inputs will produce different performance.
                    For example, a clever algorithm may
                    notice that the input is already sorted
                    and not try sorting it again. So, we
                    distinguish between best- and worst-case
                    performance (minimum and maximum number
                    of operations performed by the algorithm,
                    over all possible legal inputs of a given size).
                    (There is also the concept of
                    "average-case," but it is tricky,
                    as it requires a definition of what average
                    means: technically, you need to specify
                    a <i>distribution</i> of the inputs.
                    We will mostly stay away from average-case
                    analysis and focus on the worst case;
                    we will occasionally look at the best case too.)

                      What we really want, is not the running time
                      (as the number of operations,
                      say, in the worst case), for a specific
                      input size, but as a function of the
                      input size, over all sizes. For example,
                      it may be that a given sorting
                      algorithm requires <em>4n<sup>2</sup> + 4n + 24</em>
                      operations to sort <em>n</em> items.

                    In particular, we want to focus on the highest power of n in any
                    function expressing the run time of an algorithm. That is because, as
                    input size grows, that power will dwarf all others in significance.
