                What is dynamic programming?
            </summary>

                <p>
                    Memoization!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The name is largely a marketing construct. Here is the
                    inventor of the term, Richard Bellman, on how it came about:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "I spent the Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND.
                    My first task was to find a name
                    for multistage decision processes.
                    An interesting question is, Where did the
                    name, dynamic programming, come from?
                    The 1950s were not good years for
                    mathematical research.
                    We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named Wilson.
                    He was Secretary of Defense,
                    and he actually had a pathological fear
                    and hatred of the word research.
                    I'm not using the term lightly; I'm using it precisely.
                    His face would suffuse, he would turn red,
                    and he would get violent
                    if people used the term research in his presence.
                    You can imagine how he felt,
                    then, about the term mathematical.
                    The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air
                    Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially.
                    Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson 
                    and the Air Force from the fact that I was
                    really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation.
                    What title, what name,
                    could I choose? In the first place I was 
                    interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking.
                    But planning, is not a good word for various reasons.
                    I decided therefore to use the word "programming".
                    I wanted to get across the
                    idea that this was dynamic, 
                    this was multistage, this was time-varying.
                    I thought, let's kill two birds with one stone.
                    Let's take a word that has an
                    absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, 
                    in the classical physical sense.
                    It also has a very interesting property as an adjective,
                    and that it's impossible
                    to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense.
                    Try thinking of some combination
                    that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning.
                    It's impossible.
                    Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name.
                    It was something not even a
                    Congressman could object to.
                    So I used it as an umbrella for my activities."

                    <br>
                    Note that Bellman's claim that "dynamic" can be use
                    pejoratively is surely false: most people would not favor
                    "dynamic ethnic cleansing"!

                        Keeps calculating the same cuts again and again, much like

                        Running time is exponential in n. Why?
                        <br>
                        Our textbook gives us the equation:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img src="graphics/RecRodCutEqn.gif">
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This is equivalent to:
                        <br>
                        T(n) = 1 + T(n - 1) + T(n - 2) + ... T(1)
                        <br>
                        For n = 1, there are 2<sup>0</sup> ways to solve the
                        problem.
                        <br>
                        For n = 2, there are 2<sup>1</sup> ways to solve the
                        problem.
                        <br>
                        For n = 3, there are 2<sup>2</sup> ways to solve the
                        problem.
                        <br>
                        Each additional foot of rod gives us 2 * (previous number
                        of ways of solving problem), since we have all the previous
                        solutions, either with a cut of one foot for the new
                        extension, or without a cut there. (Similar to why each row
                        of Pascal's triangle gives us the next power of two.)
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        So, we have the series:
                        <br>
                        2<sup>n - 1</sup> + 2<sup>n - 2</sup> + 2<sup>n -

                        <br>
                        And this equals 2<sup>n</sup>. Why?

                        Much like we did with the naive, recursive Fibonacci, we
                        can "memoize" the recursive rod-cutting algorithm and
                        achieve huge time savings.

                        <br>
                        That is an efficient top-down approach. But we can also do
                        a bottom-up approach, which will have the same run-time
                        order but may be slightly faster due to fewer function
                        calls. (The algorithm uses an additional loop instead of
                        recursion to do its work.)

                        programming is going to be a good approach: a recursive
                        solution involves repeatedly solving the same problems.

                        This is quite different than, say, a parser, where the code
                        sub-problems are very unlikely to be the same chunks of
                        code again and again, unless we are parsing the code of a
                        very bad programmer who doesn't understand functions!

                There are many ways to parenthisize a series of matrix
                multiplications. For instance, if we are parenthisizing 
                A<sub>1</sub> * A<sub>2</sub> * A<sub>3</sub> * A<sub>4</sub>,
                we could parenthisize this in the following ways:
                <br>
                <br>
                (A<sub>1</sub> (A<sub>2</sub> (A<sub>3</sub> A<sub>4</sub>)))
                <br>
                (A<sub>1</sub> ((A<sub>2</sub> A<sub>3</sub>) A<sub>4</sub>))
                <br>
                ((A<sub>1</sub> A<sub>2</sub>) (A<sub>3</sub> A<sub>4</sub>))
                <br>
                ((A<sub>1</sub> (A<sub>2</sub> A<sub>3</sub>)) A<sub>4</sub>)
                <br>
                (((A<sub>1</sub> A<sub>2</sub>) A<sub>3</sub>) A<sub>4</sub>)
                <br>
                <br>
                Which way we choose to do so can make a huge difference in

                    Why is this different than rod cutting? Think about this
                    for a moment, and see if you can determine why the problems
                    are not the same.

                    <p>
                    In rod cutting, a cut of 4-2-2 is the <i>same cut</i> as a
                    cut of 2-2-4, and the same as a cut of 2-4-2.
                    <br>
                    That is not at all the case for matrix parenthisization.

                        lowest-level result in a table, avoiding recomputation, and
                        then combine those lower-level results into higher-level
                        ones. The indexing here is very tricky and hard to follow
                        in one's head, but it is worth trying to trace out what is

                    As mentioned above, recursion with memoization is often a viable
                    alternative to the bottom-up approach. Which to choose
                    depends on several factors, one of which being that a
                    recursive approach is often easier to understand.
                    If our algorithm is going to handle small data sets,
                    or not run very often, a recursive approach 
                    with memoization may be the right answer.
