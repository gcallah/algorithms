        Why not just Big-&Theta;?
        </p>
        <p>
        From the Khan Academy site:<br>
        <blockquote>
        We use big-&Theta; notation to asymptotically bound the 
        growth of a running time to
        within constant factors above and below. 
        Sometimes we want to bound from only
        above. For example, although the worst-case 
        running time of binary search is &Theta;(lg n),
        it would be incorrect to say that binary search runs in 
        &Theta;(lg n) time in all cases.
        What if we find the target value upon the first
        guess? Then it runs in &Theta;(1) time. 
        The running time of binary search is never worse than 
        &Theta;(lg n), but it's sometimes better. 
        It would be convenient to have a form of
        asymptotic notation that means 
        "the running time grows at most this much, but
        it could grow more slowly."
        We use "big-O" notation for just such occasions.

        Let's say we posit a search operating in <em>2n + 3</em> time.<br>
        We want to show that this has &Theta;(n) complexity.<br>
        We must find <em>k<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>k<sub>2</sub></em>,

        One solution is <em>k<sub>1</sub> = 1</em>, <em>k<sub>2</sub> = 3</em>,

        <p>
            The Fibonacci discussion is not in the textbook. 
        One place where it is presented in a nice way similar to what I will do in class is in
        section 0.2 of the DasGupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani <em>Algorithms</em> book.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Talked about the obvious recursive algorithm;
        how it is very slow, intuitively due to recomputing the same subproblems. 
        Proved that the recursion tree grows at least as fast as the Fibonacci sequence itself. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>Sketch of Proof</h4>
        <p>
        Note that every leaf of the recursion tree returns one. The sum of the value
        of all of these leaves is going to be the Fibonacci number we return.
        Therefore, there must be at least as many operations as the Fibonacci number
        itself.
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
        Showed how to speed the recursive algorithm algorithm up by "memoization":
        Using a table to store answers for subproblems already computed. 
        Analyzed the running time and space of the recursive memoized version and of
        the iterative algorithm that fills the table going in the forward direction. 
        Pointed out how to reduce space to constant.

        <p>
        By the way, this is an open-source project: you may contribute!
        </p>
        
        <p>
        There is a closed-form formula for computing Fibonacci numbers. 
        </p>
        <p>
        
        So why can't we claim we can compute <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number in constant time?
        Did not go into details, but this is related to our inability to directly represent
        irrational numbers such as square roots, maybe related to precision/rounding,
        and generally related to what operations are allowed and what are not, in an algorithm. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Using some tricks one can construct <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number
        in <em>O(log n)</em> arithmetic operations, where we count additions/subtractions/multiplications
        and do not worry about the fact that eventually the numbers get too large to manipulate
        in constant time.

            <li>
        Write the recursive "memo-ized" version of Fibonacci that I did not write.
        You may use pseudo-code or actually write real code in... Python, Perl,
        Java, C++... or you suggest a language!
            <li>Write a queue.
            <li>What is the Big-&Theta; order of the naive Fibonacci calculation?
        </ul>
