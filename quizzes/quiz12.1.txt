Suppose the numbers 7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2 are inserted in that order into an initially empty binary search tree. The binary search tree uses the usual ordering on natural numbers. What is the in-order traversal sequence of the resultant tree?#8 9 4 6 2 3 0 1 5 7#^0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9#0 2 4 3 1 6 5 9 7 8#7 5 1 0 3 2 4 6 8 9
