A good use for a direct-address table might be:#^All answers are fine#Memoization#Bingo#Marking members of a set as present
We can't use direct-address tables when#^there are a large number of (potential) entries#all answers are fine#we are programming the Sieve of Eratosthenes#we are dealing with zipcodes
What is direct addressing?#Fewer keys than array positions#^Distinct array position for every possible key#Fewer array positions than keys#None of the mentioned
