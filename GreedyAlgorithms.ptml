                    A family of problems and approriate solutions

                <p>
                    It is important to recognize that we have been dealing with a
                    family of problems and solutions to those problems:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Optimal substructure</b>:
                        <br>Recursive solution.
                    <li><b>Optimal substructure with overlapping sub-problems</b>:
                        <br>Recursion with memoization or dynamic programming.
                    <li><b>Optimal substructure where only the locally optimal choice
                            matters</b>:
                        <br>Greedy algorithms.
                </ul>

                    What is a greedy algorithm?
                </summary>

                <p>
                We have an optimization problem.
                <br>
                At each step of the algorithm, we have to make a choice, e.g.,
                cut the rod here, or cut it there.
                <br>
                Sometimes, we need to calculate the result of all possible
                choices.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When we do so from the top down, we have a <i>recursive
                    algorithm</i>. A naive recursive algorithm may be very
                    expensive, but we can significantly reduce its run-time by
                    <i>memoizing</i> it.
                    <li>When we do this calculation from the bottom up, we are
                        employing <i>dynamic programming</i>.
                </ul>

                <p>
                But sometimes, we can do much better than either of those
                choices. Sometimes, we don't need to consider the global
                situation at all: we can simply make the best choice among the
                options provided by the local problem we face, and then
                continue that procedure for all subsequent local problems.
                <br>
                <br>
                An algorithm that operates in such a fashion is a <i>greedy
                algorithm</i>. (The name comes from the idea that the
                algorithm <i>greedily</i> grabs the best choice available to it right
                away.)
                <br>
                <br>
                Clearly, not all problems can be solved by greedy algorithms.
                Consider this simple shortest path problem:

                <br>
                <br>
                A greedy algorithm choosing the shortest path from <i>a</i> to <i>d</i> will
                wrongly head to <i>b</i> first, rather than to <i>c</i>.

                <p>
                    Suppose we need to schedule a lecture hall with the goal of
                    maximizing the number of lectures it can hold, given the
                    constraint that no lectures can share the space.
                    <br>
                    We have the activities sorted in order of increasing finish
                    time:
                    <br>
                    <i>f<sub>1</sub> &le; f<sub>2</sub> &le; f<sub>3</sub>

                    <br>
                    We have several sets of mutually compatible lectures, e.g.:
                    <br>
                    {<i>a</i><sub>3</sub>,
                    <i>a</i><sub>9</sub>,
                    <i>a</i><sub>11</sub>}
                    <br>
                    However, this set is larger:
                    <br>
                    {<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>,
                    <i>a</i><sub>4</sub>,
                    <i>a</i><sub>8</sub>,
                    <i>a</i><sub>11</sub>}
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    How do we find the maximum subset of lectures we can
                    schedule?
                </p>

                    The optimal sub-structure of the problem
                    </summary>

                    <p>
                    It is easy to see that the problem exhibits optimal
                    substructure. <i>If</i> the optimal solution includes a
                    lecture from 4 to 6, then we have the sub-problems of
                    scheduling lectures that end by 4, and lectures that start
                    at 6 or after. Obviously, we must solve each of those
                    sub-problems in an optimal way, or our solution will not be
                    optimal! (Think of our problem of traveling from MetroTech
                    Center to Yankee Stadium via Grand Central.) Our textbook
                    calls this a "cut-and-paste" argument: we can cut an
                    optimal set of lectures ending by 4 and paste it into our
                    supposed optimal solution: if the solution was different
                    before 4, we have improved it, so it wasn't actually
                    optimal!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is straight forward to see that we can solve this problem
                    with a recursive, memoized algorithm -- we examine each
                    possible "cut" of a "middle" lecture, and recursively solve
                    the start-to-middle problem, and the middle-to-end problem.
                    Or we could use a bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm,
                    developed from the recursive solution in the same way we
                    saw in our last lecture.

                    Making the greedy choice

                    <p>
                    But we can solve this problem much more efficiently. At
                    each step in solving it, we can make a completely <i>local</i>
                    choice: what activity (still possible) finishes earliest?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since we have sorted the activities in order of increasing
                    finish time, we simply choose <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, since
                    it is guaranteed to finish at least tied for first.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The proof that this will give us a maximal set of
                    activities is trivial: Let us suppose <i>a</i><sub>j</sub>
                    is the activity in some set that finishes first, but that
                    there is a maximal subset A<sub>k</sub> that does <i>not</i> include
                    <i>a</i><sub>j</sub>. We simply remove the first element of
                    A<sub>k</sub> and substitute in <i>a</i><sub>j</sub>. This
                    is guaranteed to be a compatible set of activities, since
                    <i>a</i><sub>j</sub> finishes first, and it will be
                    maximal, since it is the same size as A<sub>k</sub>. (Note

                    The algorithm it Is straightforward: find the first compatible 
                    activity, then call the algorithm again with the rest of the activity list.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One trick worth noting: the authors put a dummy activity in the
                    first position of the list, so that there is no special first
                    call of the function.

                    There is a <b>design pattern</b> here: oftentimes, it is
                    better to modify a data structure than to do special coding for
                    end cases.

                    As usual, it is fairly simple to transform the recursive
                    algorithm into an iterative version. The authors discuss tail
                    recursion in this section: let's review what this is.

                    For a greedy algorithm to work, the optimal choice must not
                    depend upon any sub-problems or any future choices.

                    To prove that a greedy choice will be appropriate for some
                    problem, we typically examine an optimal solution, and then
                    show that substituting in a greedy choice will also yield an
                    optimal solution.

                    This is simpler then for dynamic programming

                    We use induction to show that making the

                        We begin operating on an alphabet &Sigma;. At each step,
                        we create a new alphabet, &Sigma;', with two symbols of

                        other. And that is clearly optimal! (An alphabet of
                        size 1 is a non-problem!)
                        <br>

                        for input of size <i>n</i> - 1.
                        <br>
                        At each step in the algorithm, we replace the two least
                        frequent remaining symbols <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> with a
                        new symbol <i>ab</i>, whose probability is the sum of
                        the probabilities of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.
                        <br>
                        We always want the lowest frequency symbols to have the
                        longest encoding length.
                        <br>
                        Any choice among symbols at the lowest frequency will
                        be fine, since they all have equally low frequency. So
                        we can pair any of those lowest frequency symbols as we
                        wish.

                        Now assume that there is an encoding &Sigma;'' that is
                        derived from &Sigma; (like &Sigma;') but differs in
                        choosing to combine <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> into a
                        <i>xy</i>. But since we made the greedy choice,
                        <i>xy</i> can be at best tied with <i>ab</i> meaning
                        &Sigma;'' is at best another optimal encoding, and our
                        encoding &Sigma;' is optimal after all.

                        The definition of a matroid
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        We are looking at general conditions for <i>independence</i>
                        of choices. All three problems turn out to be
                        surprisingly similar. They are all <i>matroids</i>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We have a matroid when the following independence
                        conditions are satisfied:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>&empty; is independent.
                        <li>If set J is independent and I is a subset of J,
                            then I is independent.
                        <li>If I and J are independent, and cardinality(I) &lt;
                            cardinality(J), then there is some <i>j</i> in J
                                and not in I, so that I &cup; <i>j</i> is also
                                independent.
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        A matroid consists of (S, I), where S is a set, and I
                        is a set of subsets of S, for which axioms 1-3
                        above are satisfied.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        All three situations described above, the vector space,
                        the graph, and the matching problem, turn out to be the
                        <i>same</i> matroid. (Technically, they are <i>isomorphic</i>
                        matroids.)
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        The bases of a matroid
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        A subset in I is a <i>basis</i> for a 
                        matroid if it is a <i>maximal</i>
                        subset, which here means it is not contained in any
                        larger subset that is in I.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So in the above examples, the bases are:
                        <br>
                        {a, b, c} {a, b, d}, {a, b, e} {a, c, d} {a, c, e}
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Theorem</b>: Every basis of a matroid is of the same size.
                        <br>
                        <b>Proof</b>: Let assume that there are some bases
                        A and B of a matroid such that |B| < |A|.
                        <br>
                        Then by the exchange axiom (#3 above), there is some
                        element <i>a</i> of A that can be moved into B, and B
                        will still be independent.
                        <br>
                        Therefore, it was <i>not</i> a maximal independent subset after
                        all!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Translation into the different matroid realms:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The dimension of a vector space is the size of any of
                        its bases.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Every spanning tree has the same number of edges.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We are proving things about vector spaces and graphs
                        simply by examining the axioms of matroids!

                        the sub-problems in many ways, while the rod-cutting
                        problem simply makes one level of cuts. It would be
                        more like the matrix problem if it also bundled
                        packages of cut rods into higher level bundles.
                        <br>
                        Or, rod cutting: ---|--|--|--|------|--
                        <br>
                        The vertical lines represent cuts.
                        <br>
                        Whereas, matrix chaining: (((A A) (A (A A))) (A A) ((A A
                        A)) A)

                    <li>For the activity selection problem, besides simply
                        choosing the activity this finishes first, what other
                        greedy choices could we make?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Answer</b>: The activity that starts first, the
                        activity with the smallest time requirement.
                        <br>
                    <li>On page 419, line 2 of pseudo-code loops, and the
                        comment describing why it is looping is incorrect. What
                        is actually going on there? Why isn't the code just
                        grabbing the first element in the activity array, which
                        must be the one that finishes first?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Answer</b>: The code has to find not the first
                        activity that finishes, but the first one that starts
                        after the "current" time and finishes first. So it must
                        loop until it finds that item.
                        <br>
                    <li>Show that the fractional knapsack problem (p. 425) has the
                        greedy choice property.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Answer</b>: We can take as much as possible of the
                        highest value per weight item first. If we fill the
                        knapsack, we are done. If not, we can take as much as
                        possible of the second-highest value item, and repeat
                        until the knapsack is full. Each choice is completely
                        independent of subsequent choices.
