            Dynamic Programing Video
        </h1>
            <p>
            A brief lecture discussing a dynamic programming problem, and the
            conditions under which one can and cannot use a greedy
            algorithm.
            <br />
            The context of this presentation assumes that students have already
            been introduced to both dynamic programming and greedy algorithms,
            but are puzzled as to when one or the other 
            technique applies (something I have found is a common problem).
            <br />
            And the idea that opportunity cost is the differentiator here needs
            to be refined a bit: I only arrived at this today while preparing
            this lecture. The refinement is needed because even in the activity
            selection problem, there is <i>some</i> opportunity cost: you still
            forego some activities in taking the greedy choice. But the
            opportunity cost does not "spillover" into other choices. I have
            begun work on trying to formalize this notion, and will produce a
            paper stating this relationship more precisely.
