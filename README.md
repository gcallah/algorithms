# algorithms
A project to implement the algorithms from Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein) in Python.

So far, we have:

sorting.py: contains bubble, merge, insert, and quick sorts.

heap.py: contains heapsort and priority queues.

div_and_conquer.py: contains maximum subarray and matrix multiplicaiton.

fibonacci.py: investigate the performance characteristics of different fibonacci implementations.
