        <h1>Lecture 2 (Sept 19, 2016): A Review of Big-O, Summation and Algebra
            <a href="#note1">*</a>
        </h1>

    <h2>A review of Big-O, summations and algebra. </h2>
    <h3>Why have different notations?</h3> 
    <p>
    Why not just Big-&Theta;?
    </p>
    <p>
    From the Khan Academy site:<br>
    <blockquote>
    We use big-&Theta; notation to asymptotically bound the 
    growth of a running time to
    within constant factors above and below. 
    Sometimes we want to bound from only
    above. For example, although the worst-case 
    running time of binary search is &Theta;(lg n),
    it would be incorrect to say that binary search runs in 
    &Theta;(lg n) time in all cases.
    What if we find the target value upon the first
    guess? Then it runs in &Theta;(1) time. 
    The running time of binary search is never worse than 
    &Theta;(lg n), but it's sometimes better. 
    It would be convenient to have a form of
    asymptotic notation that means 
    "the running time grows at most this much, but
    it could grow more slowly."
    We use "big-O" notation for just such occasions.

    <h3>Meaning of constants in O, &Theta; and &Omega; expressions</h3>
        <p>
        Let's say we posit a search operating in <em>2n + 3</em> time.<br>
        We want to show that this has &Theta;(n) complexity.<br>
        We must find <em>k<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>k<sub>2</sub></em>, 
        and <em>n<sub>0</sub></em>, so that:
        <em>k<sub>1</sub> * n < 2n + 3 < k<sub>2</sub> * n</em>
        <br>
        One solution is <em>k<sub>1</sub> = 1</em>, <em>k<sub>2</sub> = 3</em>,
        and <em>n<sub>0</sub> = 4</em>.
        <br>
        Let's demonstrate!
        </p>

  <h2>Algorithmic design in action:</h2>
  <h3>Fibonacci numbers</h3> 
  <p>
    The problem of computing, given <em>n >= 0</em>,
    the <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number <em>F<sub>n</sub></em>.

  </p>

<p>
    The Fibonacci discussion is not in the textbook. 
One place where it is presented in a nice way similar to what I will do in class is in
section 0.2 of the DasGupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani <em>Algorithms</em> book.
</p>

<p>
Talked about the obvious recursive algorithm;
how it is very slow, intuitively due to recomputing the same subproblems. 
Proved that the recursion tree grows at least as fast as the Fibonacci sequence itself. 
</p>

<h4>Sketch of Proof</h4>
<p>
Note that every leaf of the recursion tree returns one. The sum of the value
of all of these leaves is going to be the Fibonacci number we return.
Therefore, there must be at least as many operations as the Fibonacci number
itself.
</p>


<p>
Showed how to speed the recursive algorithm algorithm up by "memoization":
Using a table to store answers for subproblems already computed. 
Analyzed the running time and space of the recursive memoized version and of
the iterative algorithm that fills the table going in the forward direction. 
Pointed out how to reduce space to constant.
</p>
<p>

    Naive and faster Fibonacci code.</a>
</p>
<p>
By the way, this is an open-source project: you may contribute!
</p>

<p>
There is a closed-form formula for computing Fibonacci numbers. 
</p>
<p>

So why can't we claim we can compute <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number in constant time?
Did not go into details, but this is related to our inability to directly represent
irrational numbers such as square roots, maybe related to precision/rounding,
and generally related to what operations are allowed and what are not, in an algorithm. 
</p>
<p>
Using some tricks one can construct <em>n</em>th Fibonacci number
in <em>O(log n)</em> arithmetic operations, where we count additions/subtractions/multiplications
and do not worry about the fact that eventually the numbers get too large to manipulate
in constant time.
</p>
    
<h2>Data structures</h2>
<p>
Data structures form a very important part of algorithmic research. 
</p>

<p>
However, this course does not focus on data structures. 
We will only devote a couple of lectures, total, to this subject. 
(There are algorithms courses that spend their entire time on data structures. 
We have an advanced data structures expert in the department, Prof. John Iacono.)
