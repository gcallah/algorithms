"""
This file contains Python implementations of hashing algorithms from
Intro to Algorithms (Cormen et al.).
The aim here is not efficient Python implementations (we'd just call
the native sort if we wanted that) but to duplicate the pseudo-code
in the book as closely as possible.
Also, since the goal is to help students to see how the algorithm
works, there are print statements placed at key points in the code.
The performance of each function is stated in the docstring, and
loop invariants are expressed as assert statements when they
are not too complex.
This file contains:
    direct_addr_search()
    direct_addr_insert()
    direct_addr_delete()
    direct_addr_guessing()

    chained_hash_insert()
    chained_hash_search()
    chained_hash_delete()

    open_hash_insert()
    open_hash_search()

    Plus auxilliary functions that support the above.

"""
Here are our open hashing functions. CLRS simply returns the hash
key's index. At the index is only the hash key itself. Thus, they pseudo-code
a completely useless hash table, since if we look up "Rahul", we get back
the index of "Rahul," and if we retrieve what is at that index, the answer
is... "Rahul"! But if I already have Rahul at hand, I certainly don't need
to search a hash table to retrieve... Rahul. Thus, we added an actual value,
which does not really complicate the pseudo-code very much.
Also, their naming here breaks the pattern they have established with
"direct_addr" and "chained" by not using the prefix "open" so we use it.
We also want our own table for the open addressing functions, since we want to
initialize to None, not an empty list.
