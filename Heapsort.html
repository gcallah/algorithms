            <p>
            Heaps are used in many famous algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path,
            the heap sort sorting algorithm, implementing priority queues, and more. Essentially, heaps are the 
            data structure you want to use when you want to be able to access the maximum or minimum element very
            quickly.There are many variations of heaps, each offering advantages and tradeoffs.<br>

            <b>Definition</b><br>
            The (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree 
            as shown in the figure below.Each node of the tree corresponds to an element of the array. The tree is 
            completely filled on all levels except possibly the lowest, which is filled from the left up to a point.

            Three are two types of heaps: <br>
            1) Max Heap <br>
            2) Min Heap <br>

            In the max heap the parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the root node 
            is the one with the highest key value. 
            <br>
            In the case of min heap the keys of the parent nodes are always less than or equal to those of the children 
            and the lowest key is in the root node.

                    Maintaining the heap property
                </summary>
            <p>
            Heapify is a procedure for manipulating heap data structures. 
            It is given an array A and index i into the array.
            The subtree rooted at the children of A[i] are heap but node A[i]
            itself may possibly violate the heap property i.e., A[i] < A[2i]
            or A[i] < A[2i +1]. The procedure 'Heapify' manipulates the tree 
            rooted at A[i] so it becomes a heap. In other words, 'Heapify' 
            is let the value at A[i] "float down" in a heap so that subtree 
            rooted at index i becomes a heap.<br><br>
            There are two general versions of the heap property: a min-heap property and a max-heap property.

                which means that a node can't have a greater value than its parent. In a max-heap, the largest element
                 is stored at the root, and the minimum elements are in the leaves.

            <p>
            Heapify picks the largest child key and compare it to the parent
            key.
            If parent key is larger than heapify quits, otherwise it swaps the
            parent key with the largest child key. So that the parent is now
            becomes larger than its children.It is important to note that swap
            may 
            destroy the heap property of the subtree rooted at the largest
            child node.
            If this is the case, Heapify calls itself again using largest
            child node as the new root. <br><br>

            <p>
            Heapsort is a comparison based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. Like mergesort,
            heapsort has a running time of O(nlogn) and like insertion sort, heapsort sorts in-place so no extra
            space is needed during the sort. The binary heap data structure allows the heapsort algorithm to take
            advantage of the heap's heap properties and the heapsort algorithm makes use of the efficient running 
            time for inserting to and deleting from the heap.

                </summary>
            <p>
            The heap sort algorithm starts by using procedure BUILD-HEAP to 
            build a heap on the input array A[1 . . n]. Since the maximum 
            element of the array stored at the root A[1], it can be put into 
            its correct final position by exchanging it with A[n] (the last
            element in A). If we now discard node n from the heap than the
            remaining elements can be made into heap. Note that the new 
            element at the root may violate the heap property. All that is 
            needed to restore the heap property. <br><br>
            <code>
            HEAPSORT(A) <br>
            &nbsp BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A) <br>
            &nbsp for i = A.length downto 2 <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      exchange A[1] with A[i] <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      A.heap-size = A.head-size - 1 <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      MAX-HEAPIFY(A, 1) <br><br><br>
            </code>
            The HEAPSORT procedure takes time O(n lg n), since the call to 
            BUILD_HEAP takes time O(n) and each of the n -1 calls to Heapify 
            takes time O(lg n).

            Altohugh heapsort is an excellent algorithm, a good implementation
            of quick sort which you are gonna learn later is gonna beat 
            heapsort in practice. The heap data structure has a lot of varied 
            use but it is most popularly used to implement priority queues.<br>
            <br>According to wikipedia: A <strong>Priority queue</strong> is an 
            abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data
            structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" 
            associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high
            priority is served before an element with low priority. If two 
            elements have the same priority, they are served according to 
            their order in the queue.

                    To run the example from the textbook, type:
                    <br/>
                    <code>
                        A
                        <br/>
                        # MAX or MIN
                        <br/>
                        build_heap(A, MAX)
                        <br/>
                        heapsort(A, MAX)
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you can experiment with the algorithm by typing
                    in your own array (my_array = [x, y, z])
                    and running build_heap(my_array) or
                    heapsort(a_array, b_array).
                </p>
