                Why do we pass in a node rather than the tree itself?
                <br>
                Note why CLRS pseudo-code for max and min contains mistake
                from practical point of view.
                <br>
                Library code versus application code.
                <br>
                Library must protect itself against both malicious and merely
                inept users. So, need to check for NIL input!
                <br>
                <br>
                Recursive versus loop: compare the two searches.
                <br>
                <br>
                All searching functions (search, minimum, maximum, predecessor,
                successor) run in <em>O(h)</em> time, where <em>h</em> is the height of
                the tree.

                We search by starting with the root node. If it's key is equal
                to the key for which we are searching, we are done: that is the
                key we want.
                <br>
                On the other hand, if we have a NIL node at hand, we are also done,
                but have failed to find the key.
                <br>
                Finally, if neither is true, we check the key at hand against
                the key sought for.
                <ul>
                    <li>If k &lt; curr.key, recursively call tree search on curr.left.

                <br>
                Imagine we are seeking the successor of 3. The right tree of
                three is non-empty. So we simply seek the minimum of that tree,
                which is the leftmost node in the tree, in this case, 4.

                <br>
                On the other hand, take this tree, and start with node 10.

                Deletion is by far the most complicated coding of any of these

                    NIL.

                    <br>
                    <b>Action:</b> Replace z by its left child.
                <li>z has two children.

                        <li>If y is z's right child, replace z by y.
                        <li>Otherwise, replace y by its own right child, then
                            replace z by y.

                Let's walk through deleting 8 in tree 2 above.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>8 has two children, so we are in case 4.
                <li>The successor of 8 is 9.
                <li>9 is not the right child of 8.
