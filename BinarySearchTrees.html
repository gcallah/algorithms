            </summary>
            <p>
                Why do we pass in a node rather than the tree itself?
                <br>
                Note why CLRS pseudo-code for max and min contains mistake
                from practical point of view.
                <br>
                Library code versus application code.
                <br>
                Library must protect itself against both malicious and merely
                inept users. So, need to check for NIL input!
                <br>
                <br>
                Recursive versus loop: compare the two searches.
                <br>
                <br>
                All searching functions (search, minimum, maximum, predecessor,
                successor) run in <em>O(h)</em> time,
                where <em>h</em> is the height of the tree.

                    We search by starting with the root node.
                    If it's key is equal to the key for
                    which we are searching, we are done: that is the
                    key we want.
                    <br>
                    On the other hand, if we have a NIL node at hand,
                    we are also done, but have failed to find the key.
                    <br>
                    Finally, if neither is true, we check the key
                    at hand against the key sought for.

                    Imagine we are seeking the successor
                    of 3. The right tree of three is non-empty. So we simply
                    seek the minimum of that tree,
                    which is the leftmost node in the tree, in this case, 4.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the other hand, take this tree, and start with node 10.

                    10 has no right child, so its successor must lie further up

                <li>For the first tree above, write the steps that will take place
                    when we insert 11.
                </li>
                <li>Write recursive versions of TREE-MINIMUM and
                    TREE-MAXIMUM.
                </li>
                <li>Compare the deletion of the node with key == 8
                    in Tree 2 that takes place following our
                    textbook's algorithm with what the first visualizer linked
                    to above actually does in this situation. Clearly, two
                    different binary trees result. What algorithm is being used
                    by the visualizer? (You could build different trees and see
                    what it does: this is called <b>reverse engineering</b>.)
                    If both algorithms always build valid BSTs, is there some
                    reason we should prefer one algorithm or the other?
                </li>
                <li>Keys are input to a binary search tree (BST) in the following order:
                        5, 10, 15, 20, 25.
                    Draw the resulting BST.

                <li>Keys are input to a binary search tree (BST) in the following order:

                    Draw the resulting BST.

                    Trace the process that occurs when inserting key 18.

                    Trace the process by which the successor of 80 will be
                    found.
