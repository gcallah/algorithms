        <h2>Looking at Memoization</h2>
        <p>
            Last class, I asked you to <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">
            memoize</a>
            the naive, recursive Fibonacci algorithm. Let's take a look at how to do that.
            <br>
            <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/algorithms/blob/master/python/fibonacci.py">Here</a>
            is the Fibonacci code, now including memo-ization.

        Dictionary ADT.

        <p>
        Operations associated with this data type allow:
        <ul>
            <li>the addition of a pair to the collection
            <li>the removal of a pair from the collection
            <li>the modification of an existing pair
            <li>the lookup of a value associated with a particular key
        </ul>
            <p>
            (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array">Source</a>)
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
        Typical uses:
        <ul>
            <li> Symbol lookup in a programming language
            <li> Counting words in a book
            <li> Store colors by name as key and their numeric equivalent as
            the value. Then we can write <b>set_text(colors["red"])</b>.
        </ul>

        <em>Direct addressing</em> and <em>Hashing</em> are two ways of implementing a
        dictionary. Are there others?
        </p>

        <h3>
        Direct addressing. 
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> <em>O(1)</em> <em>worst</em> case time for lookup.
            <li> Uses:
            <ul>
                <li> Memoization
                <li> Bingo
                <li> Sieve of Eratosthenes
                <li> Mark zipcodes seen
            </ul>
            <li> Downside: wastes space. If you have no idea how many possible
            keys you need, direct addressing is not a good choice.
            <br>For instance, if your key is an arbitrary string!

            <li> Because <em>size(U) > m</em>, collisions are always possible.
            <br>Imagine we hash by word length: 'mark' and 'beam' both hash to
            4. (Stupid hash function, but it illustrates the idea.) We must
            resolve this collision somehow.
            <li> Resolve collisions by chaining:
            <br> Each slot holds a linked list of values.

        Simple uniform hashing 
        </h4>
        <p>
        This employs <b>chaining</b>. Furthermore, we assume that the
        distribution of elements is uniform across hash table slots.
        <br>

            <ul>
                <li> Hash table <em>T</em> with <em>m</em> slots storing <em>n</em> elements.
                <li> <b>Load factor</b>: <em>&alpha; = n / m</em>
                <br> <em>&alpha;</em> is the average number of elements stored in a
                chain.
                <li> Our analysis is in terms of <em>&alpha;</em>, which can be
                less than, equal to, or greater than one.
                <li><b>Worst case</b> is very bad:
                <br>All <em>n</em> keys hash to the same slot.
                <br>Worst case for searching becomes <em>&Theta;(n)</em> plus
                time to compute hash function.
                <br>We could have just used a linked list directly!
                <li><b>Average case</b>:
                <br>Assuming any given element is equally likely to hash into
                any slot...
                <br>We get average case <em>&Theta;(1 + &alpha;)</em> time.
                <br>See proofs in our textbook.
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Hash functions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> First, convert key to an integer.
            <br> E.g., we can interpret characters in a string by their ASCII values.
            <br> Then treat each value as a digit in a radix-128 integer.
            <br>

                See this article for more on radices.</a>)
            <li> Keys could be many other things besides strings.
            <br> E.g., genomes:
            <br>
            <img

            height="320" width="340">
            <li> Division method:
            <br><em>h(k) = k mod P</em>, where <em>P</em> is a
            suitably-chosen prime number.
            <li> Multiplication method:
            <br><em>h(k) = [m (k A mod 1)]</em>,
            where <em>0 < A < 1</em>.
        </ul>

        <h4>
        Universal hashing
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Establish a <em>family</em> of hash functions.
            <li>Choose so that <em>Prob[h(x) = h(y)] <= 1/m</em>, where m is
                the size of our hash table.
            <br>In other words, the hash functions have no more chance of
            collision than simply randomly choosing to slots between 1 and m.
            <li>Choose one at random each execution.
            <br>Tricky: what if we store hash values?
            <li>Good average case behavior
            <br>If a "bad" function handles some
            data once, a "good" one will handle it another time.
            <br>So a "bad" set of programming variable names one run will turn
            into a good set the next run.
        </ul>

        <h4>Open addressing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>All elements are stored directly in the table; no chaining.
            <li>Linear probing
            <br>Easy: just move along array indices!
            <br>Prone to clustering
            <li>Quadratic probing
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_hashing">
                Double hashing
            </a>
            <br>Uses two hash functions to search array for key.

        <p>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Devise three possible hash functions. Analyze each for size of hash
            table necessary and possibility of collisions.
            <li> Let's say our hash function is <em>h(k) = k mod 11</em> and we resolve
            conflicts with chaining. Analyze what happens if our data values are
            23, 34, 12, 8, 19, 33, 2, 5, 15, 4, 31, 9, 3, 6, 18, 8, 19 and 22.
            <br>What will happen when we look up 19?
            <li>Write (pseudo) code to resolve collisions with chaining. 
        </ul>
