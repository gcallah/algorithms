                    Can one walk the city crossing every bridge once and only
                    once?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Euler answered "No." Why?
                    <br>
                    View the land as vertices. The bridges are edges. There is
                    an <i>Eulerian walk</i> on a graph only if it is connected
                    and has either zero or two edges of odd degree.

                    Representations of graphs
                </h3>
                    <p>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are two standard representations: 
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Adjancency lists
                        <li>Adjancency matrices
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Consider the following graph:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img
                        src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-cs-algorithms/social_network_num.png">
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Following our text, we will prefer adjancency lists.
                        But, as CLRS point out, in an especially dense graph,
                        or when we need to detect an edge quickly, we might
                        prefer a matrix.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Here are the two different representations of this
                        graph:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Adjacency list:

                        <br>
                        Adjacency matrix:

                        <img src="graphics/AdjMatrix.png">
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For the adjancency matrix:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img src="graphics/GraphsEq1.gif">
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Trade-offs
                    </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adjacency list is generally smaller and at
                                worst as large as adjacency matrix. We use it
                                for sparse graphs, where E is singificantly
                                less than V<sup>2</sup>. 
                            <li>Adjacency matrix is simpler. It also allows
                                quicker search for whether some specific edge
                                is present or not.
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Both forms can be used to represent directed,
                            undirected, and weighted graphs.
                            <br>
                            For weighted graphs, we can store 0 or the weight
                            in the matrix instead of just 0 or 1. For the list, we
                            store a tuple (vertex, weight) in the adjancency list of a
                            vertex.
                            <br>
                            For directed graphs, in a list, <i>i</i>, say, would have
                            an entry for <i>j</i>, but <i>j</i> would not for <i>i</i>.
                            In a matrix, m[i][j] would be 1, but m[j][i] would
                            be 0.
                        </p>

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                    For pseudo-code, we just represent attribute <i>f</i> of
                    edge <i>(u, v)</i> as <i>(u, v).f</i>. (<i>f</i> might
                    represent the edge already having been visited, for
                    instance.)

                    <br>
                    In a real program, there are many, many ways to store
                    additional information. How to best do this will very much
                    depend on your application. I have found this can work:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a class <i>node</i>.
                        <li><i>node</i> has an instance variable
                            <i>adj_list</i>.
                        <li>Anything you want to put in a graph should
                            sub-class node.
                        <li>Voila! You can store any attributes whatsoever with
                            each node.
                    </ul>

                    The sort makes no sense on undirected graphs or cyclical

                        Many advanced graph algorithms rely on de-composing a
                        graph into strongly directed components, and then
                        processing those, and then combining the results:
